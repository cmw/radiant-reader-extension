Hello <%= @reader.name %>,

Welcome! An account has been created for you at <%= @site_title %>. To activate it, all you have to do is click on this link:

  <%= @activation_url %>

(If your email program hasn't turned that into a link, just paste the address into a web browser window.)

On this first visit you'll be logged in automatically, but next time you'll need to know your username and password: Here's a reminder:

  login at: <%= @login_url %>
  username: <%= @reader.login %>
  password: <%= @reader.current_password %>

You can see yourself as others might see you here:

  <%= @my_url%>
  
And change your listing and preferences here:

  <%= @prefs_url%>

We're about to forget the plain-text version of your password, so we won't be able to remind you what it is. If you get stuck, you can always make a new one by clicking on the 'forgot my password' link on the login page.

best wishes,

<%= @sender %>
