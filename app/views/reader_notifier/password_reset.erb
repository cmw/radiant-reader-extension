Dear <%= @reader.name %>,

Someone has requested that a new password be generated for your account at <%= @site_title %>.

If that person wasn't you, please don't be concerned: you are seeing this message, not they, and your password hasn't changed. You can safely ignore this message.

If it was you, and you would like to reset your password, please click on this link:

	<%= @url %>
	
That will bring up a form in which you can enter (and confirm) a new password. If that link is wrapped over more than one line, it might fail. In that case you can either piece it back together or just enter this magic string of nonsense into the box provided:

	<%= @token %>

If you can remember your current password and all you want to do is change it, you can skip this step and go straight to the preferences page:

	<%= @prefs_url %>

best wishes,

<%= @sender %>
